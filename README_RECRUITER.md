# CapyUniverse — Applied AI Engineering Hub

## What it is

**CapyUniverse** is an experimental platform focused on **applied artificial intelligence**.
It is not a single product, but a **modular hub** used to design, test and evolve AI-powered web tools.

The project explores how large language models can be embedded into **real, usable applications**, not just demos or notebooks.

---

## Why it exists

Many AI projects stop at proof-of-concept.
CapyUniverse focuses on:
- End-to-end application flows
- Real user interfaces
- Integration of LLMs into actual product logic

It bridges the gap between **AI models and usable software**.

---

## What problems it explores

- How to structure LLM usage inside web applications
- How to manage context and prompts effectively
- How to decouple AI logic from UI
- How to build flexible, evolvable AI architectures

---

## Technical focus

- LLM integration via APIs (Gemini, OpenAI)
- Prompt engineering and context management
- Simple data and processing pipelines
- Modular front-end architecture
- Clear separation of concerns

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite
- AI: Gemini API, OpenAI API
- Data: JSON-based pipelines, in-memory state
- Tooling: Git, REST APIs

---

## Engineering mindset

CapyUniverse is built with:
- Curiosity-driven development
- Strong focus on learning and iteration
- Preference for clarity over over-engineering
- Real-world application scenarios

---

## Status

Ongoing experimental project, continuously evolving as new ideas, tools and approaches are tested.
